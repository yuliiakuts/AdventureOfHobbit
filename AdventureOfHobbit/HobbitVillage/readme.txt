Welcome to the Hobbit Adventure Game!

Let us introduce you to the main character. Meet Frodo the Hobbit! 

You know him well. He’s just returned from his journey to the Mediterranean where he drowned the Ring in lava. 
And he was enjoying his rest and writing memoirs. But suddenly he received a letter from Gandalf. 
He had hidden a golden key somewhere in the village and he can’t name the place because of many enemies. 
But he left Frodo some clues!

So, after a glass of beer Frodo decided to prepare for his trip to Gendalf, it’s winter, Frodo needs a hat, 
a coat and he needs a bag for his stuff and food.
